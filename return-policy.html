  <h1>Returns &amp; Refund Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 31 Aug 2025</p>
  <p>At AHM Studios, our goal is to deliver exceptional creative work. This policy explains when returns or refunds may apply and how to request them.</p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Services (creative work):</strong> Due to the nature of bespoke services, refunds are generally not offered once work has commenced. We provide revisions per your package to address reasonable concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital deliverables:</strong> Non-tangible goods (e.g., downloadable/online files) are non-returnable once delivered/accessed, except where required by law or where files are defective.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical goods (if any):</strong> Eligible for return within <strong>14 days</strong> of delivery if unused, in original condition/packaging.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How to request a return or refund</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Email <a href="mailto:[YOUR EMAIL]">[YOUR EMAIL]</a> with your order number, item/service, reason, and any supporting details (e.g., screenshots, photos).</li>
    <li>We’ll acknowledge within 2–3 business days and advise next steps.</li>
    <li>For physical goods, you are responsible for safe return shipping to: <strong>[POSTAL ADDRESS], Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong>. Keep proof of postage.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Refund method & timelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Approved refunds are issued to the original payment method where possible; otherwise via bank transfer in LKR.</li>
    <li>Allow 7–14 business days for processing after approval; card issuers may take additional time to reflect the credit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Non-returnable / non-refundable</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Customized services once delivered or substantially performed.</li>
    <li>Digital files already delivered/accessed (unless defective).</li>
    <li>Change-of-mind outside the stated windows.</li>
  </ul>
